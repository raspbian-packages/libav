libav (6:10.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

   * Disable avserver (Closes: #734335)

   It turns out that avserver is pretty much unmaintained these days and
   contains obvious bugs. The next Libav upstream release has it already
   removed, and further maintenance is currently rather unlikely. With
   this in mind, the libav package proactively disables the avserver build
   anticipating its removal upstream.

   If you are interested in having avserver back and functional, please
   help upstream with reinstantiating it.
