The scripts in this folder may be helpful for doing mass rebuilds.

How to use:

1. Upload the new Libav upstream release to experimental, make sure your
   mirror has it available.

1. Copy this folder to a temporary directory with lots of
   storage. (e.g., /srv/scratch/libav_rebuilds)

2. Identify all packages you need to rebuild either using grep-dctrl(1),
   or by scraping the Debian release tracker at
   https://release.debian.org/transitions/. List all packages in a file
   "packages.txt"

3. Review and adjust the dependencies and chroot names in
   git_experimental_source

4. Execute "./do_all_safe"

Discussion:

git_experimental_source will use the schroot chroot to download the
source package from debian/experimental in a subdirectory with the
package name. It also places a script called "build.sh" with an schroot
invocation that makes sure you have the libav packages from experimental
in your build.sh chroot avaialable. do_all_safe iterates over the
package list, download packages that have not been downloaded yet and
executes the generated $package/build.sh script.

If a build breaks, the idea is to go into that directory, and work on a
patch to fix the problem. To start over, just delete the directory and
call do_all_safe again.
